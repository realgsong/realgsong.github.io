<h1>짧은 요약</h1>
<p>어떤 남자가 빨간색 클립을 가지고 어떤 걸 만들어 낼 수 있을지 직접 실험을 한다. 1년에 걸쳐서 14번의 트레이드를 성공시켜, 조그만 종이 클립으로 집을 만들어 냈다는 이야기. 아래와 같은 순서로 교환이 이루어 졌다고 한다.</p>
<ol>
<li>On July 14, 2005, he went to Vancouver and traded the paperclip for a fish-shaped pen.</li>
<li>He then traded the pen the same day for a hand-sculpted doorknob from Seattle, Washington, which he nicknamed "Knob-T".</li>
<li>On July 25, 2005, he travelled to Amherst, Massachusetts, with a friend to trade Knob-T for a Coleman camp stove (with fuel).</li>
<li>On September 24, 2005, he went to California, and traded the camp stove for a Honda generator.</li>
<li>On November 16, 2005, he made a second (and successful) attempt (after having the generator confiscated by the New York City Fire Department) in Maspeth, Queens, to trade the generator for an "instant party": an empty keg, an IOU for filling the keg with the beer of the holder's choice, and a neon Budweiser sign.</li>
<li>On December 8, 2005, he traded the "instant party" to Quebec comedian and radio personality Michel Barrette for one Ski-doo snowmobile.</li>
<li>Within a week of that, he traded the snowmobile for a two-person trip to Yahk, British Columbia, in February 2006.</li>
<li>On or about January 7, 2006, he traded the second spot on the Yahk trip for a cube van.</li>
<li>On or about February 22, 2006, he traded the cube van for a recording contract with Metalworks in Mississauga, Ontario.</li>
<li>On or about April 11, 2006, he traded the recording contract to Jody Gnant for a year's rent in Phoenix, Arizona.</li>
<li>On or about April 26, 2006, he traded the one year's rent in Phoenix, Arizona, for one afternoon with Alice Cooper.</li>
<li>On or about May 26, 2006, he traded the one afternoon with Alice Cooper for a KISS motorized snow globe.</li>
<li>On or about June 2, 2006, he traded the KISS motorized snow globe to Corbin Bernsen for a role in the film Donna on Demand.[3]</li>
<li>On or about July 5, 2006, he traded the movie role for a two-story farmhouse in Kipling, Saskatchewan.</li>
</ol>

<p>스스로 1년 간 실험을 했다는 것도 대단하고, 거의 한달에 한번 이상의 물물교환을 성사시키기 위해서 시장의 기회를 찾아 다녔을 노력과 협상을 성공시키는 추진력이 놀랍다.</p>
