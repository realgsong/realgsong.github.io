<blockquote>I think one of the most important things, for me anyway, when building something from the ground up like that is, <strong>as quickly as possible, getting the program to a state that you, the programmer, can use it.</strong> Even a little bit. <strong>Because that tells you where to go next in a really visceral way</strong>.<br />
-- Jamie Zawinski, Coders at Work</p></blockquote>
<p>유저의 입장에서 빠른 피드백을 받는 것이 중요하다. 이게 진정한 의미의 Bottom up approaching 일 것이다.</p>
